---++ The documentation of <nop>NatSkin is crap. I'm lost!
If you need help, there are a couple of options:
   * Create a support request on Foswiki:Support/WebHome.
   * Explain the problem on Foswiki:Development/NatSkin.
   * Join the [[irc://irc.freenode.net/foswiki][#foswiki]] IRC channel and ask for help.
   * Contact the [[mailto:daum@wikiring.com][WikiRing]] in case you need 
     professional support.

In any case, helping out improving documentation, fixing bugs, helping others
with the same problems is very welcome.

---++ Why does <nop>NatSkin depend on so many extra plugins?
The main goal is to achieve the best user experience possible. It frankly
does not matter if that requires extra plugins.

Some things can't be done with the inventory being shipped with standard
Foswiki. A lot of the plugins once have been an integral part of the
NatSkinPlugin and then been externalized into plugins of their own for the
greater benefit. 

---++ Why are there so many template files?
<nop>NatSkin does not build upon the standard templates/skin of Foswiki as
it differs substantially in the way it is broken up into components. Therefore, 
every function of the core engine will use a =*.nat.tmpl= file. In fact,
the <nop>NatSkin templates are created to provide an independent base
for further template modifications. 

<nop>NatSkin templates offer much more flexibility than the standard 
templates do. While its theming engine controls which css files are to
be loaded, it also maintains the =SKIN= path to allow themes to override
the standard markup. So switching a theme does also switch the =SKIN= path
and the templates with it.

---++ Can I enable offsite link detection?
Yes. Use the ={NatSkin}{DetectExternalLinks}= configuration setting.

---++ Does <nop>NatSkin support <nop>QuietSave?
This feature confuses more than provide any added value and has thus been removed from
the =edit= page to simplify the interface.
